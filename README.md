# Linux Basics

My personal Linux learning notes & quick command references.

I'm documenting the commands and concepts I'm studying on my path to becoming a **Junior Linux System Administrator**.

### What's in this repo
- Basic everyday commands (date, cal, whoami, pwd, su, clear...)
- File & directory basics (coming soon)
- Users, groups & permissions (coming soon)
- Processes, services & more (coming soon)

### Important note
These are **my personal study notes**.  
I use AI tools to help organize, format, and make the content clearer, more readable, and visually comfortable — but all the content is based on what I'm actually learning and practicing.

Goal: Build strong Linux fundamentals → land a Linux admin / infrastructure role after graduation.

Feedback & corrections are always welcome!  

🐧 Happy learning!
